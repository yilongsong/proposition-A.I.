<h2>üìñ Documentation</h2>
<h3>Main Documentation (#TODO)</h3>

<h3>In-code Documentation</h3>

The in-code documentation is autogenerated from docstrings. All functions, classes, and methods should have a docstring that explains what they do, what the arguments are, and what the return value is. We follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) for docstrings.

Here is an example of a well-documented function:

```python

def my_function(arg1: int, arg2: str) -> float:
    """This is a short description of the function. (It should be a single sentence.)

    This is a longer description of the function. It should explain what
    the function does, what the arguments are, and what the return value is.
    It should wrap at 88 characters.

    Examples:
        This is a section for examples of how to use the function.

        .. code-block:: python

            my_function(1, "hello")

    Args:
        arg1: This is a description of arg1. We do not need to specify the type since
            it is already specified in the function signature.
        arg2: This is a description of arg2.

    Returns:
        This is a description of the return value.
    """
    return 3.14
