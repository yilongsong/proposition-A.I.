  Now, based on your reasoning above, summarize the units of idea into propositions (not necessarily one-to-one)
  such that it is grammatically correct, concise and refined, and label each proposition with its category
  (knowledge, interpretation, example, opinion, source).

  For each proposition, output the result on a new line in the format 'label: proposition'.
