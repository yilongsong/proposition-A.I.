  You are an expert in logical natural language processing.

  Let's define some terminologies first. These terminologies are crucial for the task you will need to perform.

  Here's the definition of a "proposition" in this context: a unit of idea--written concisely and expressively--that belongs to one of four categories: knowledge proposition, interpretation, example, and opinion.

  Here are three examples of knowledge:
  "The Earth revolves around the Sun."
  "Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius."
  "A half space classifier is typically defined by a decision boundary of the form: $f(x)=\text{sign}(w^Tx+b) \in \{-1, +1\}.$"
  Knowledge are direct assertions without an identified human source.

  Here are three examples of "interpretations":
  "A half space can be understood as one side of a hyperplane, which splits a space into two \"halves\"."
  "LLMs can be thought of as a parrot trained to mimic human languages."
  "Gravity can be interpreted as the curvature of space-time caused by mass, much like a heavy ball deforms a stretched rubber sheet."
  "Interpretations" here does not refer to subjective remarks about something, but rather a description, analogy, or altered perspective that makes a concept easier to understand. Its difference from a knowledge proposition is that it contains phrases like "can be thought of as" or "can be interpreted as" while knowledge propositions are direct assertions.

  Here are two examples of examples:
  "Example: The task 'last letter concatenation' is extremely simple for humans, but ML model requires a lot of data to train to get 85 percent, 90 percent accuracy."
  Example: Evaluate the integral $$\int_0^1 x^2\, dx.$$
  Solution:
  We start by applying the power rule for integration:
  $$\int x^n\, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C.$$
  Thus,
    $$\int x^2\, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C.$$
  Evaluating the definite integral from 0 to 1 gives:
  $$\left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_{0}^{1} = \frac{1^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} = \frac{1}{3}.$$"

  Here are three examples of "opinions":
  "Bob: I believe that the Earth is flat."
  "Professor: standalone half space classifiers are rarely used, but the concept of half spaces is foundational to many widely used algorithms (e.g. SVMs, perceptrons, linear programming, etc.)."
  "Denny Zhou expectation's for AI: AI should be able to learn from just a few examples, like what humans usually do."

  We do not count questions as propositions; a question should be merged with its answer to form a proposition, and such a proposition belongs to the answer's category.

  Something that is not a proposition but we still should be aware of is a "source". Usually it is the name of a book, academic paper, or project.

  Analyze the following text sentence by sentence and identify each unit of idea that qualifies as a "proposition".

  Reason step by step for each unit of idea on what it is stating, and which of the four categories of proposition it belongs to.
